	  When Buffalo Burger opened its first store in 2010, <br >
	  the idea was simple: demonstrate that food served fast didn't have to be a Junk-food experience.<br >
	  We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking fire-grilled burgers methods, <br >
	  clean environments and distinctive wrapping-features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining.<br >
	  When we opened, there wasn't an industry category to describe what we were doing.<br >
	  In four years, more than 18 restaurants opened.<br >
<br >
We compete in a category of dining now called fast-gourmet, the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry,<br >
 where customers expect food quality that's more in line with full-service restaurants, <br >
 coupled with the speed and convenience of fast food.<br >
<br >
We try to do a few things really well.
 We elevate basic raw ingredients into food that's richer and more sophisticated through our recipes and cooking techniques. <br >
 Similarly, our restaurant design transforms simple materials in distinctive ways, <br >
 giving our restaurants a style that's more architectural in nature and less dependent on standardized design elements.<br >
<br >
Our focus has always been on using higher-quality ingredients and cooking techniques to make great food accessible to all people at reasonable prices.<br >
 But our vision has evolved. While using a variety of fresh ingredients remains the foundation of our menu,<br >
 we believe that fresh is not enough, anymore. Now we want to know the sources for all of our ingredients<br >
 so that we can be sure they are as flavorful as possible.<br >
<br >
<b>Mission</b><br >
Buffalo Burger, the Business of Good Food <br >
We aim to do a few things but do them exceptionally well. <br>
the goal was simple: to serve high quality,<br > 
delicious food quickly with an experience that not only exceeded, but redefined<br > the fast food experience 
and create happy people = happy customer concept. <br >
To that end, we focus on sourcing the best possible ingredients, <br >
serving the tastiest food, and growing the most capable team <br >
<br >
<b>Vision</b><br >
The best quick service restaurant presenting gourmet burgers in a fine dine experience in the local, regiognal, and the international market. <br >
We aim to succeed in the four milestones of our business cores&nbsp;Customers, team members, franchisees, and shareholders.<br >
